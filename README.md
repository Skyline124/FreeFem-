# FreeFem-

This is a very simple syntax highlighting for FreeFem++ in SublimeText 3.
I cannot guarantee this would work with your version.

You should only need to copy the folder "FreeFem++ directly into your "Sublime Text 3/Packages" folder
For example on OSX El Capitan this would be:
/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/FreeFem++

Sublime should detect automatically the new package and create a syntax highlight with the name "FreeFem++".
